Cover a large baking sheet with paper towels. Slice potatoes lengthwise into ¼” rounds, then cut each round lengthwise into sticks. Place in a Dutch oven and pour over oil until potatoes are just covered. Turn heat to high and bring oil to a boil, about 5 minutes. 
Without stirring, cook potatoes 15 minutes. Then use tongs to gently loosen any sticks that are stuck to pan. Continue to cook until potatoes are golden and crispy, about 10 minutes more.
Use a large slotted spoon to transfer fries to paper towel-lined sheet. Immediately season with salt.
